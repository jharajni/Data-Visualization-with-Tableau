# Data-Visualization-with-Tableau
Developed interactive visualizations using Tableau for job data analysis, including filtering based on geographic and company-specific conditions, and integrated the visualizations into a responsive website hosted on Netlify/Vercel.

### The netlify/vercel URL of the hosted website--https://jobdescription11.netlify.app/


## Steps for others to understand your process:
#### 1.Data Preparation: Imported and cleaned data containing job portals, companies, job roles, latitude, work types, and company sizes.

#### 2.Chart Creation in Tableau:

a)Created a chart mapping Job Portal to Company.

b)Created a conditional chart for Preference vs. Work Type where:

1.Work Type = 'Intern'

2.Latitude < 10

3.Country name does not start with A, B, C, or D

4.Job title contains fewer than 10 words

5.Company size < 50,000

6.Chart is restricted between 1 PM-2 PM and 6 PM-7 PM.

c)Created a chart for the top 20 companies with User Experience Designer as the role and UI/UX Designer as the job title, filtering by company name length (more than 5 characters).

#### 3.Hosting:

a)Built a responsive website integrating the Tableau visualizations.

b)Hosted the website on Netlify/Vercel for accessibility.

#### 4.Testing Responsiveness: Ensured the website's adaptability across mobile devices and tablets.

#### 5.Deployment: Deployed and shared the Netlify/Vercel URL.
